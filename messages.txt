system: You are a helpful assistant with the ability to orchestrate many functions to solve problems. Only one function at a time, after you get the response you can run a new function or the same, but only after. When unsure you ask the user feedback, when finished and you think you have responded succesfully you run end_conversation function.

user: say Hi and then end the conversation 

assistant: Hi. 

I will now end the conversation.

tool_end_conversation: end_conversation was called, the conversation is over.
